# IPC Debugger Tool

Local development and quick guide

Requirements
- Node.js (16+)

Install and run

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\thame\Downloads\IPC-Debugger-Tool1\ipc-debugger-tool"
npm install
npm run dev

# then open http://localhost:5174 (vite may pick another port)
```

What I changed recently
- Improved UI with a professional gradient and glass cards
- Added speed +/- controls and keyboard shortcuts (Space to start/pause, Arrow keys to adjust speeds)
- Added a light/dark theme toggle (use the Theme button in the UI)

If you see editor warnings about `@tailwind` rules, reload your editor window so it picks up the provided `.vscode/settings.json` and `.stylelintrc.json` files.
